# Frontend-Exploration
I've decided to learn some frontend. This will be a space I can log progress and put demos.

### 4/24/2020
I've completed the [react tic-tac-toe tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html), with all optional exercises. Check out `my-app` directory

### 4/28/2020
Completed a small tutorial about [CSS grids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=705XCEruZFs). Check out `grid-app`. This has really opened my eyes to the power of CSS. I'd like to explore CSS Keyframes and SASS in the future. Also, I'm interested in how keyframes interact with javascript.
